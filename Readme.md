### Management

Valère and Me had to create a python chess mate game based on the real rules.
So basicly we first started by dividing up the tasks between both of us.

Valère has to work on " " so I had to work on the " ".
That was a project with a 3 Months deadline so we had to choose wisely how we had to work.

The first days were about brainstorming. 
Then come the first weeks right after the brainstorming, we used this time as an important one.
We decided how we would execute, so we had to use our knowledge about Python and ChessMate, to use on-line documentations to reach out our ideas.

Then come fews days after our beginning works.
At the end, we're now able to play our ChessMate hopefully we're in the deadline and so on, I'm down writing this fully filled readme as my last job.

### Our issues and how we reach them

The first issue we instantly spot was to manage the pulls requests and the commits.
A senior would have to pass aways the commentaries about them but as Juniors they really helped both of us to follow our work wisely without to check every moment if there was an error or not. Github begun now an habit!

Rajoutes en si tu en as d'autres ou osef.
